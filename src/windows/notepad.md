# Notepad

Notepad is useful when I don't want to open a full-fledge IDE.

The default Notepad in Windows is actually pretty decent now, with multi-tab and session state.

## Configuration
1. Launch notepad
    ```powershell
    notepad
    ```
2. Click on the settings, open `Font` and change it to `Hack Nerd Font`
3. Scroll down and turn off `Spell check` and `Autocorrect`
