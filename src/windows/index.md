# Getting Started
This section sets up tools for development on Windows.

By following this guide, you should end up with a minimal setup that can be used for development.
Then, you can start installing extra tools.

## General Order
This guide follows these general installation order:
1. First we will install Windows requirements for setting up `dotbin`
2. Then we will install `dotbin` and set up the environment
3. Finally we will install extra software with `dotbin`

## Sudo for Windows
This guide assumes you have Sudo for Windows installed. Currently, you must be on the **Insider Dev Channel** to use sudo for Windows. See https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/introducing-sudo-for-windows/

If you are not planning to switch, simply run the command as an administrator.
