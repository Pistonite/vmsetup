# Tools
Guides for setting up common tools for every platform.

If a tool is only ever used on one platform (such as Visual Studio), it will be in the platform's section, not here. If I start using it for multiple platforms though, I will move it here.

When you go through the setups for a platform, it will tell you to install `dotbin` by going through the instructions for [Essential Tools](./rust.md). After that, you should continue with that platform's setup, and come back here to install additional tools.
