# Node.js

## Install with NVM
I only need v18 LTS. You can install other versions too
```bash
nvm install 18 --lts
```
It should automatically be selected as the active node version. You can also manually switch to it
```bash
nvm use 18
```
You can list all the versions with
```bash
nvm ls
```
And confirm the current node version
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```
