# Version Switcher
Versions switchers are useful if you need multiple versions of the same thing and need to switch between them. It's commonly used for `node.js` and `python`

## NVM
We will be using [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install and manage node versions. The following command is taken from the repo installation instructions.

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
```

## Pyenv
We will be using [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to switch between python versions
```bash
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```
