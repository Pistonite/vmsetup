# Task
Task is an alternative task runner than `just`. It allows jobs and dependencies
to be executed in parallel.
It also has better compatibility with Windows.

Check out the website: https://taskfile.dev/

## Install
```bash
yay -Syu go-task
```
:::warning
There's already a package called `task`, which is why
this package and binary is called `go-task`.
My `.bashrc` adds an alias that makes it `task`
