# Next Steps
The next steps depend on the purpose of the system:

- For development only over SSH, 
  you can head straight to collect more tools [here](../tool/)
- For a system with graphical display, you probably want to set up
  a [Desktop Environment](./de/)
- For a production server, see [Production Server](../prod/)

For a vendored device, you should probably also follow their
manual to install the latest drivers and BIOS updates,
and optionally enable [Secure Boot]( https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface/Secure_Boot )
