# Next Steps
The next steps depend on the purpose of the system:

- For development only over SSH, 
  you can head straight to [Essential Tools](./tool/essentials.md)
- For a system with graphical display, you probably want to set up
  a [Desktop Environment](./de/)
- For a production server, see [Production Server](../prod/)
